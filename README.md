## Que lo que, tiburon? 🤙🏻
Welcome to my page.

I'm Lorenzo, Data Science student from University of Pisa.

I enjoy working on cutting-edge projects that solve real-world problems. If it involves climate, economics, or accidentally training a model that thinks pigeons are drones, I'm interested.

## Fun Facts:
The first to buy a round at the pub with friends 🍻, and also the first to hit the floor!
I can't read just one book at a time 📚 — there are always several stacked on my bedside table, leaning like the Tower of Pisa.
